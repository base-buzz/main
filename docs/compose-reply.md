## Responsiveness Notes / Implementation Details

- This view might be implemented as a modal that slides up or a separate route.
- The main text input should auto-expand vertically as the user types (using `react-textarea-autosize` or similar).
- The parent post context might be truncated if too long.
- The action toolbar icons trigger corresponding pickers or UI elements.
- The layout needs to adapt dynamically to the keyboard appearing/disappearing.
- The character count indicator needs to update as the user types.
