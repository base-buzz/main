## Responsiveness Notes / Implementation Details

- This view is primarily a form, so standard mobile form styling is key (sufficient touch targets, clear labels, appropriate input types).
- Use appropriate HTML input types (`text`, `textarea`, `url`, `date`) styled with Tailwind.
- Disclosure arrows indicate navigation or opening modals/pickers.
- The scrollable container needs appropriate padding-bottom.
- Consider using a library like Radix UI for robust form components (like Switch for "Tips") if needed.
