## Responsiveness Notes / Implementation Details

- This view is typically implemented as a drawer component that slides in from the left (`translate-x` properties in Tailwind controlled by state).
- Requires an overlay element behind the drawer to dim the background content when open.
- Needs logic to open/close the drawer (e.g., triggered by avatar tap, swipe gesture).
- Ensure sufficient touch targets for all navigation items.
- The list content might need to be scrollable if the number of items exceeds the screen height.
- The background content (visible on the right side in the screenshot) should not be interactive while the drawer is open.
